### Hi there!!
I am Chaitanya Sahu, a final year student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer Intern at Smarsh where I mostly am working on backend related stuff and contributing to real-world projects.

I have built several projects using MERN stack during my college days.

I also love solving DSA problems on platforms like Leetcode and GFG. This helps me improve my logical thinking and problem-solving skills ( Need some skills to tackle problems in my life too :) ).

I love to explore and experiment with different technologies, tools and frameworks.
